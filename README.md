====


Krakow, 30.07.2018


### Motivation
finally, 2d layouts are first-class citizen
tricks vs support
CSS Grid is well supported in new browsers
CSS becomes production standard in couple years

### Questions:
* how many folks does use flexbox?
* who still uses float:left or inline block?

### What we did previously?
* <table> 
* <div style="float:left"> 
* display: inline-block
* column-count: 3;
* calc(100% - 80px);
* preprocessor
* bootstrap :/ ugh
* Mutation Observers
* flexbox

### Basic demo
* display:grid
* grid-template-columns:200px 400px 
* grid-gap

### Flexibility
* 1fr
